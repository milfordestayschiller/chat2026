        If this happened within the first couple of messages, be wary! It is a well-known tactic for con artists to move your

        <strong>Be especially skeptical of <i class="fab fa-whatsapp"></i> WhatsApp</strong> or trading phone numbers. Scammers
        can do <strong>a lot</strong> of harm with just your phone number, e.g. by plugging it into a people search website
        and bringing up lots of personal information about you.
