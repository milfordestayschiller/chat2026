            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your camera controls:</strong> Clicking on the
                    <button type="button" class="button is-small is-success px-1">
                        <i class="fa fa-video mr-2"></i>
                        Share webcam
                    </button>
                    button will enable your webcam and your video may be watched by other people
                    in the chat room. While broadcasting, you can Stop your webcam, Mute your
                    microphone, and see who is currently watching you by clicking on the
                    <button type="button" class="button is-small is-info is-outlined ml-1 px-1">
                        <i class="fa fa-eye mr-2"></i>

                    </button>
                    button, which will show the number of watchers inside the button itself.
                    <ul>

                            The <button type="button" class="button is-small is-outlined is-dark px-1">

                            </button>
                            button will toggle the setting on your camera. If you are going to be
                            behaving sexually on cam, we ask that you please mark your own camera
                            as 'Explicit' by using this button. The button will illuminate in red
                            when active, and look like:
                            <button type="button" class="button is-small is-danger px-1">
                                <i class="fa fa-fire mr-1"></i> Explicit

                        {{end}}
                        <li>
                            You can also see who is Watching your camera by clicking on the "Watching"
                            tab on the Who's Online list.

                <li>
                    The <strong>Who Is Online</strong> list shows all of the people who are currently connected
                    to the chat room. The Who List is global to the entire chat - it is the same list
                    of people no matter which Channel you are currently looking at. In the Who List
                    you may also find buttons to open a Direct Message (DM) or tune in to somebody's
                    webcam if they are currently broadcasting.
                    <ul>

                            This button will open their profile page, if they have one. The icon may
                            be color-coded for the user's gender, if available: <i class="fa fa-user has-text-gender-male"></i> male,

                            This button will open a Direct Message (DM) chat with this person.

                            </button>
                            This button will open the user's webcam, if they are broadcasting.
                            A <strong class="has-text-info">blue</strong> button means they're live,
                            a <strong class="has-text-danger">red</strong> means their video feed is
                            marked <abbr title="Not Safe For Work">NSFW</abbr> or explicit. A greyed
                            out button means they are <em>not</em> currently broadcasting their video.

                <li>
                    The <strong>Channels &amp; DMs</strong> panel lists the available public chat channels
                    you may participate in as well as any currently open DMs for private one-on-one chats
                    with other people. Some channels may have notification counters beside them to indicate
                    unread messages have appeared.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Note:</strong> the Chat Rooms are just public channels that <em>everybody</em>
                            is "in" and is designed to organize public conversations into various topics. For example,
                            one chat room may be a dedicated space for people to share photos on chat so that the
                            main conversation channels don't get spammed too much with those photos.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>Message entry box</strong> at the bottom of the screen is how you type a
                    message and send it to the currently selected Channel or DM conversation.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In public channels you may <strong>send a picture</strong> by clicking on the picture
                            button to the left of the message box.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may <strong>add an emoji</strong> to your message by clicking on the smile icon
                            to the right of the message box.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may <strong>at-mention</strong> people in chat by typing the "@" symbol, which
                            should prompt an auto-complete of users currently online. You may hit the Tab key
                            to insert the currently selected name into your message.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the upper right, the <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> <strong>Menu</strong> button houses
                    some options such as the <i class="fa fa-gears"></i> <strong>Chat Settings</strong>.
                    Some interesting features in there include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Video scaling:</strong> you can make the webcam videos larger on
                            your screen to see your chat partners in better detail.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Sound effects:</strong> by default it plays a sound when you receive
                            a new Direct Message but you can also turn on sound effects for public chat
                            messages and when people join or exit the room. If the chat room is currently
                            empty, you could set a sound effect when somebody joins so you know there may
                            be someone to chat with then!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                On <strong>mobile web browsers</strong> that don't have large enough screens to show everything
                at once, the Chat Room screen is shown by default and buttons appear in the corners to get to
                the two side panels (to change channels or manage your DMs, and to see Who Is Online and tune
                in to their webcams, respectively).

            <p>
            If somebody on chat is bothering you, you may <strong>mute</strong> their messages by clicking
            on the red <i class="fa fa-comment-slash has-text-danger"></i> button on their message.
            </p>

            <p>

            <ul>
                <li>You will no longer see their future messages in public chat rooms.</li>

                <li>
                    They will not be allowed to watch your webcam if you are sharing. The chat
                    server will lie and tell them your camera <em>isn't even online</em> so they
                    will not know they had been muted.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            The mute is <strong>temporary</strong> and will last for the remainder of your chat
            session (until you log off).

            <p>
            The WebRTC technology used by this chat room allows for direct, <strong>peer to peer</strong>
            connections between you and the other chat members to stream video and audio directly to one
            another, without needing a server in the middle to relay all that data. In many cases, WebRTC
            should "just work" but you may run into trouble broadcasting if your local network is heavily
            firewalled (for example on a corporate or school network).
            </p>

            <p>
            In many WebRTC video apps (such as Zoom, Jitsi, Google Hangouts, etc.), when one or both parties
            are on such difficult networks, a server in the middle is used to transfer the video data between
            them. BareRTC does not have any such server, as the bandwidth costs to carry your video could get
            expensive! If your video sharing is not working, it's unfortunate but you should still be able to
            have text chat conversations as normal.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Notice:</strong> because of the peer-to-peer nature of the webcam feature, it is possible
            that your chat partner may discover your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank">IP address</a>
            if they check their local computer's connections. This is true of all WebRTC-based video chat systems.
            Also, it is possible that your chat partner may "screen record" your video -- also true of all video
            sharing systems. Please inform a moderator if you know somebody is violating your privacy in this

                <a href="#video-size" class="fa fa-paragraph is-size-6"></a>
            </h3>

            <p>
                There are a few methods available to change the size of videos on the chat room,
                depending on whether your device has a mouse cursor or is a touch screen (such as a tablet).
            </p>

            <p>
                Options that may work with all devices (with mouse or touch screen):
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Chat Settings: by clicking on the blue menu button on the top-right corner of the page, the
                    Display tab has a "Video size" dropdown with some options to change the size of all videos
                    open on your screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On wide screens (such as an iPad in landscape orientation): when you have videos open, look
                    for the <i class="fa fa-magnifying-glass-plus"></i> <i class="fa fa-magnifying-glass-minus"></i>
                    buttons in the header just above the video dock. Clicking on these buttons will scale the docked
                    videos larger or smaller (in similar increments as the Chat Settings dropdown).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If you are on a device with a mouse cursor, such as a desktop or a laptop with a touchpad, there
                are a couple of ways to resize individual videos how you see fit:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    When videos are docked in the top of the page, hover your mouse over the bottom-right corner
                    of a video. It should show a 'resize' cursor, and you can click and drag from the bottom-right
                    corner to resize the video.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Videos can also be "popped out" of the dock at the top of the page. The pop-out button appears
                    on top of videos, next to the mute audio button. When popped out, you can drag videos anywhere
                    on the page and you can resize them by dragging from any edge except the top.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                And finally: you can put a video "full screen" too. In the control buttons at the bottom of each
                video (beginning with the mute audio button), the one on the right will toggle the video into a
                full screen view.
            </p>

                All features of the chat room, including webcam sharing, should generally work on all current
                web browsers and devices (Firefox, all Chromium browsers including Google Chrome or Microsoft
                Edge, Safari, Androids and iPads).

            </h1>

            <p>
            Some of the privacy considerations with this chat room include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The server does not maintain long-term state of chat history. Messages are pushed out as
                    soon as they come in, and users are forgotten when they log off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, the server does keep temporary <strong>log files</strong> to help the server admin
                    troubleshoot issues and check on the health of the server. These logs may include chat
                    messages sent to public channels. Private chat (DMs) are <em>not</em> logged by default.
                    If the server is running in debug mode (which provides a ton of telemetry to diagnose issues),
                    the contents of DMs may be logged since debug mode will record the low-level chat protocol
                    messages sent between the server and clients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the administrator has enabled it, your <strong>recent direct message</strong> histories
                    may be recorded (for your convenience) in a database. Old messages expire off after about 90
                    days, and you can clear all your DMs history from the Chat Settings -> Misc tab. DMs are only
                    logged when the associate website logs you in to the chat room, so that only you can access
                    them to remember where you left off with a chat partner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chat moderators <strong>DO NOT</strong> get to see the contents of your Direct Message
                    conversations - that feature is not programmed in to this chat room. The server logs which
                    might capture your conversations are usually not actively monitored. Consider taking your especially
                    sensitive conversations to a different platform if you are very concerned about it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Webcam sharing is <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> so it is possible that your chat partner
                    could identify your IP address by checking their computer's open connections. But this is
                    true of basically all WebRTC webcam services and is part of how WebRTC works.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As with all video sharing services, it is always possible that your chat partner may screen
                    record their computer and thus record a copy of your video. This is a risk inherent with all
                    video sharing platforms - you can't control what software the other party may be running,
                    so choose your risk tolerance accordingly.
                </li>

            <p>
                If you see an error message from <strong class="has-text-danger">ChatClient</strong> that says
                something like "Webcam error: Permission denied" or a "NotAllowedError," this section is for you.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason for this error is that your web browser did not grant access to your Camera and Microphone
                for the chat room to use. This may be because you accidentally clicked on the "Deny" button when your
                browser asked you for permission, or because your web browser <em>itself</em> does not have permission for
                these devices on your computer.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you encounter this error, there are two places to look to resolve this:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    In your web browser's settings (e.g. in Google Chrome or Firefox), make sure that you are granting
                    permission for your Camera and Microphone to the chat room's website ({{.Hostname}}).
                </li>
                <li>
                    In your operating system's settings, ensure that your web browser itself has permission to use
                    your Camera and Microphone. <strong>Notice:</strong> on recent Mac OS and Windows systems, your
                    web browser might not have permission by default to access these devices!
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Please see the following sections for in-depth guidance on where to look.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Notice:</strong> webcam sharing will require both your Camera <em>and</em> your Microphone
                permission - if either one is denied, webcam sharing will fail.
            </p>

            <h4>1. Check your web browser's permissions for {{.Hostname}}</h4>

            <p>
                Go into your web browser's settings, to the "Privacy" or "Permissions" section and verify that
                <code>{{.Hostname}}</code> has permissions to use your Camera <strong>and</strong> your Microphone.
                Or at the very least: make sure that these settings are not set to "Deny" for {{.Hostname}}.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, on <i class="fab fa-chrome"></i> <strong>Google Chrome:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Go into your browser Settings -> "Privacy and security"</li>
                <li>Click on "Site settings" <small>("Controls what information sites can use and show (location, camera, pop-ups, and more")</small></li>
                <li>From here you can check the permissions in two ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Under the "Recent activity" section, look for {{.Hostname}} or click "View permissions and data stored across sites" to look for it there.</li>
                        <li>Or: under the "Permissions" section, click into the "Camera" and "Microphone" settings to see the list of sites you've given/denied
                            permission for, and change {{.Hostname}} to "Allow" or remove {{.Hostname}} from the list of sites.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Or for example, on <i class="fab fa-firefox"></i> <strong>Mozilla Firefox:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Go into your browser Settings -> "Privacy & Security"</li>
                <li>Scroll down to the "Permissions" section where you see buttons for Camera and Microphone.</li>
                <li>Click on the "Settings..." button for Camera and Microphone to see the list of websites you've given/denied permission for.</li>
                <li>Find <code>{{.Hostname}}</code> and remove it from the list.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                After changing your browser settings, <strong>exit and restart your web browser</strong> and log on to the chat room.
                When going on webcam, hopefully your browser should ask you for permission for your webcam and microphone: be sure to
                click on "Allow" when prompted.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the change in your web browser's settings doesn't resolve the permission error, then check in your operating system's settings.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Check in your operating system's settings</h4>

            <p>
                For example, <strong>if you are on <i class="fab fa-apple"></i> Mac OS:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Click on the Apple icon in your top menu bar and open "System Settings"</li>
                <li>Click on "Privacy &amp; Security"</li>
                <li>Look for the Camera and Microphone settings and ensure that they are <strong>allowed</strong> for your web browser.</li>
                <li>For more information, try: <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-to-your-camera-mchlf6d108da/mac">https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-to-your-camera-mchlf6d108da/mac</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Or for example, <strong>if you are on <i class="fab fa-windows"></i> Windows 10 or Windows 11:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Click on the Start button > Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera, and make sure Camera access is turned <strong>on.</strong></li>

            <p>
                The most common error is a Permission Error as described above, but there are some less common
                error messages you may experience. Here is a short list of some of them:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>AbortError:</strong> e.g. "Starting videoinput failed"
                    <br><br>
                    A common cause for this error may be that your webcam device is already in use by a different program,
                    so that your web browser was not able to open it. Please make sure that you are not running another video
                    chat program (such as Skype or Zoom) which has your camera active, and try again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>NotFoundError</strong> or <strong>NotReadableError</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    This error may indicate that your camera device was not available to your web browser. For example, your
                    webcam might not be plugged in to USB or you may be missing hardware drivers for it. To begin diagnosing
                    this problem, check whether <other>other</other> websites or apps are able to use your camera: if none of
                    them can either, it heavily points toward a hardware or driver error.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Other possible errors should be uncommon. If this troubleshooting guide has not been helpful, try copying
                the error message into a search engine and find information online: all of the text following "Webcam error:"
                will be coming from your web browser, so relevant results may be found online. A possible place to start may
                be the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia">Mozilla documentation for getUserMedia.</a>

            </h3>

            <p>
                It may sometimes happen that you clicked to watch somebody else's webcam on chat, and their video doesn't
                load. If it only happens with <em>some</em> cameras (but other cameras load correctly), then the problem is
                most likely on <em>that person's</em> side and not your own: their camera likely doesn't work for anybody
                else who is trying to watch it, either.
            </p>

            <p>
                Webcam sharing on the chat room works by "peer to peer" direct connections between chatters. Usually, this
                tends to "just work" for most people, but sometimes your network connection or firewall can get in the way
                and prevent a connection from being established.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most common kinds of network conditions that cause problems connecting to webcams include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you are on a heavily firewalled network, such as in a school or workplace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are on a cellular network, e.g. from a smartphone or tablet. Some cell phone carriers
                    add firewalls to their network to prevent direct peer-to-peer connections with mobile devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are using a Virtual Private Network, or VPN: some VPN providers don't forward the kind
                    of network messages that are needed to establish a peer-to-peer connection.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                For some specific advice:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you can not connect to <strong>any</strong> webcam at all (e.g. many people are on webcam but you
                    can not get <strong>any</strong> of them to work): most likely it is because you are on a firewalled
                    network, like those listed above. If you are on a cell network, try switching to WiFi; or if you are
                    using a VPN, try turning off your VPN.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If <strong>only one or two webcams</strong> won't open for you, but others on the chat room are working:
                    the problem is likely not on your end! It is likely that the people whose cameras are not working are
                    on a firewalled network, and they are likely having worse problems than you are!
                </li>
                <li>
                    If somebody's webcam button has a slash \ through it, like <i class="fa fa-video-slash has-text-info"></i>
                    then it <em>probably</em> means that this person requires <strong>you</strong> to share your webcam first
                    before you can open theirs. You can click on their camera button to see an exact reason why their camera
                    has the \ slash through it.
                </li>
