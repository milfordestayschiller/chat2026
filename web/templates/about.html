            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your camera controls:</strong> Clicking on the
                    <button type="button" class="button is-small is-success px-1">
                        <i class="fa fa-video mr-2"></i>
                        Share webcam
                    </button>
                    button will enable your webcam and your video may be watched by other people
                    in the chat room. While broadcasting, you can Stop your webcam, Mute your
                    microphone, and see who is currently watching you by clicking on the
                    <button type="button" class="button is-small is-info is-outlined ml-1 px-1">
                        <i class="fa fa-eye mr-2"></i>

                    </button>
                    button, which will show the number of watchers inside the button itself.
                    <ul>
                        {{if .Config.PermitNSFW}}
                        <li>
                            The <button type="button" class="button is-small is-outlined is-dark px-1">
                                <i class="fa fa-fire has-text-danger mr-1"></i> Explicit
                            </button>
                            button will toggle the setting on your camera. If you are going to be
                            behaving sexually on cam, we ask that you please mark your own camera
                            as 'Explicit' by using this button. The button will illuminate in red
                            when active, and look like:
                            <button type="button" class="button is-small is-danger px-1">
                                <i class="fa fa-fire mr-1"></i> Explicit

                        <li>
                            You can also see who is Watching your camera by clicking on the "Watching"
                            tab on the Who's Online list.
                        </li>

                    The <strong>Who Is Online</strong> list shows all of the people who are currently connected
                    to the chat room. The Who List is global to the entire chat - it is the same list
                    of people no matter which Channel you are currently looking at. In the Who List
                    you may also find buttons to open a Direct Message (DM) or tune in to somebody's
                    webcam if they are currently broadcasting.
                    <ul>

                            </button>
                            This button will open their profile page, if they have one. The icon may
                            be color-coded for the user's gender, if available: <i class="fa fa-user has-text-gender-male"></i> male,
                            <i class="fa fa-user has-text-gender-female"></i> female, and

                            </button>
                            This button will open a Direct Message (DM) chat with this person.

                            </button>
                            This button will open the user's webcam, if they are broadcasting.
                            A <strong class="has-text-info">blue</strong> button means they're live,
                            a <strong class="has-text-danger">red</strong> means their video feed is
                            marked <abbr title="Not Safe For Work">NSFW</abbr> or explicit. A greyed
                            out button means they are <em>not</em> currently broadcasting their video.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    The <strong>Channels &amp; DMs</strong> panel lists the available public chat channels
                    you may participate in as well as any currently open DMs for private one-on-one chats
                    with other people. Some channels may have notification counters beside them to indicate
                    unread messages have appeared.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Note:</strong> the Chat Rooms are just public channels that <em>everybody</em>
                            is "in" and is designed to organize public conversations into various topics. For example,
                            one chat room may be a dedicated space for people to share photos on chat so that the
                            main conversation channels don't get spammed too much with those photos.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>Message entry box</strong> at the bottom of the screen is how you type a
                    message and send it to the currently selected Channel or DM conversation.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In public channels you may <strong>send a picture</strong> by clicking on the picture
                            button to the left of the message box.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may <strong>add an emoji</strong> to your message by clicking on the smile icon
                            to the right of the message box.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may <strong>at-mention</strong> people in chat by typing the "@" symbol, which
                            should prompt an auto-complete of users currently online. You may hit the Tab key
                            to insert the currently selected name into your message.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the upper right, the <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> <strong>Menu</strong> button houses
                    some options such as the <i class="fa fa-gears"></i> <strong>Chat Settings</strong>.
                    Some interesting features in there include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Video scaling:</strong> you can make the webcam videos larger on
                            your screen to see your chat partners in better detail.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Sound effects:</strong> by default it plays a sound when you receive
                            a new Direct Message but you can also turn on sound effects for public chat
                            messages and when people join or exit the room. If the chat room is currently
                            empty, you could set a sound effect when somebody joins so you know there may
                            be someone to chat with then!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                On <strong>mobile web browsers</strong> that don't have large enough screens to show everything
                at once, the Chat Room screen is shown by default and buttons appear in the corners to get to
                the two side panels (to change channels or manage your DMs, and to see Who Is Online and tune
                in to their webcams, respectively).
            </p>

            <h1 id="features">Feature Highlights</h1>

            <h3 id="emoji-reactions">Emoji Reactions</h3>

            <p>
            You may add emoji reactions to chat messages by clicking on the
            <button type="button" class="button is-small has-text-grey is-outlined px-2">
                <i class="fa fa-plus mr-2"></i> <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>
            </button>
            button at the bottom right corner.
            </p>

            <p>
            Reactions added by yourself or others will appear at the bottom of their message. You can
            see who reacted by hovering your mouse cursor over the button, or you can 'upvote' their
            reaction by clicking on it.
            </p>

            <h3>Muting spammy users</h3>

            <p>
            If somebody on chat is bothering you, you may <strong>mute</strong> their messages by clicking
            on the red <i class="fa fa-comment-slash has-text-danger"></i> button on their message.
            </p>

            <p>
            While they are muted:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>You will no longer see their future messages in public chat rooms.</li>
                <li>You will no longer receive any of their future Direct Messages (DMs).</li>
                <li>
                    They will not be allowed to watch your webcam if you are sharing. The chat
                    server will lie and tell them your camera <em>isn't even online</em> so they
                    will not know they had been muted.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            The mute is <strong>temporary</strong> and will last for the remainder of your chat
            session (until you log off).
            </p>

            <h3 id="markdown">Styling Your Messages</h3>

            <p>
            BareRTC supports Markdown syntax for your chat messages. You can make text <strong>bold</strong>
            by putting asterisks around part of it, <strong>**like this**</strong> or make text italic with
            <em>*single asterisks*</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Hyperlinks you paste that begin with https:// will be clickable as-is, or you can create a custom
            label for it by typing e.g. <code>[click my link](https://www.wikipedia.org/)</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
            To learn more about Markdown, please check out the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" target="_blank">Markdown Guide</a>
            website.

            <h1 id="video-sharing">Video Sharing How-To's</h1>

            <h3 id="webcam">About webcam sharing</h3>

            <p>
            The WebRTC technology used by this chat room allows for direct, <strong>peer to peer</strong>
            connections between you and the other chat members to stream video and audio directly to one
            another, without needing a server in the middle to relay all that data. In many cases, WebRTC
            should "just work" but you may run into trouble broadcasting if your local network is heavily
            firewalled (for example on a corporate or school network).
            </p>

            <p>
            In many WebRTC video apps (such as Zoom, Jitsi, Google Hangouts, etc.), when one or both parties
            are on such difficult networks, a server in the middle is used to transfer the video data between
            them. BareRTC does not have any such server, as the bandwidth costs to carry your video could get
            expensive! If your video sharing is not working, it's unfortunate but you should still be able to
            have text chat conversations as normal.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Notice:</strong> because of the peer-to-peer nature of the webcam feature, it is possible
            that your chat partner may discover your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank">IP address</a>
            if they check their local computer's connections. This is true of all WebRTC-based video chat systems.
            Also, it is possible that your chat partner may "screen record" your video -- also true of all video
            sharing systems. Please inform a moderator if you know somebody is violating your privacy in this
            way so that they may be banned from the chat room.
            </p>

            <h3>How do I go on video?</h3>

            <p>
                To share your webcam, click on the green
                <button type="button" class="button is-small is-success px-1">
                    <i class="fa fa-video mr-2"></i>
                    Share webcam
                </button>
                button at the top left of the web page. This will open a modal with some options for
                your camera:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    You may start with your microphone muted by default.
                </li>
                {{if .Config.PermitNSFW}}
                <li>
                    You may mark your camera as "Explicit" to begin with. If you are intending immediately to
                    behave sexually on camera, please mark this box so that your camera will appear 'red' by
                    default and other people on chat can know what they're getting into when they click to
                    watch your camera.
                </li>
                {{end}}
                <li>
                    You may opt-in to some "mutual webcam settings":
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may require your viewers to also be sharing their own camera first before they can open yours.</li>
                        <li>You may automatically open your viewer's cameras when they open yours (and they are also broadcasting).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How do I stop my camera?</h3>

            <p>
                When you are broadcasting, the red "<i class="fa fa-stop"></i> Stop" button at the top of the
                page will turn your camera off.
            </p>

            <h3>How do I mute my camera's microphone?</h3>

            <p>
                The button to <i class="fa fa-mute"></i> Mute will be at the top of the page next to the
                <i class="fa fa-stop"></i> Stop button. Alternatively, you can click on the microphone inside
                your own webcam video preview to toggle the mute that way. Either button works!
            </p>

            <h3>How do I see who is watching me?</h3>

            <p>
                You may click on the <button type="button" class="button is-small is-info is-outlined ml-1 px-1">
                    <i class="fa fa-eye mr-2"></i>
                    0
                </button> button at the top of the page to see who is watching you. The number inside the
                button will be your current number of viewers.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may also click on the <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> Watching tab in the Who's Online list.
            </p>

            <h3>How do I stop somebody from watching me?</h3>

            <p>
                On the Who's Online list, click on the <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> Watching tab to see who
                is currently watching your camera.
            </p>

            <p>
                To 'boot' somebody off your camera, click on the
                <button type="button" class="button is-small px-2 py-1"
                    title="Kick this person off your cam">
                    <i class="fa fa-user-xmark has-text-danger"></i>
                </button>
                button next to their name. This will kick them off your camera and they will not
                be allowed to re-open your cam for the remainder of <em>your</em> chat session.
            </p>

            <p>
                To people who have been booted from your camera, the chat server will tell them that
                your camera <em>isn't even broadcasting</em> at all! They will see a greyed-out video
                button and may think you have simply turned off your camera, and they won't know for
                sure that you have booted them!
            </p>

            <h1 id="browsers">Supported Browsers</h1>

            <p>
                All features of the chat room, including webcam sharing, should generally work on all current
                web browsers and devices (Firefox, all Chromium browsers including Google Chrome or Microsoft
                Edge, Safari, Androids and iPads).
            </p>

            <h1 id="privacy">Privacy</h1>

            <p>
            Some of the privacy considerations with this chat room include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The server does not maintain long-term state of chat history. Messages are pushed out as
                    soon as they come in, and users are forgotten when they log off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, the server does keep temporary <strong>log files</strong> to help the server admin
                    troubleshoot issues and check on the health of the server. These logs may include chat
                    messages sent to public channels. Private chat (DMs) are <em>not</em> logged by default.
                    If the server is running in debug mode (which provides a ton of telemetry to diagnose issues),
                    the contents of DMs may be logged since debug mode will record the low-level chat protocol
                    messages sent between the server and clients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the administrator has enabled it, your <strong>recent direct message</strong> histories
                    may be recorded (for your convenience) in a database. Old messages expire off after about 90
                    days, and you can clear all your DMs history from the Chat Settings -> Misc tab. DMs are only
                    logged when the associate website logs you in to the chat room, so that only you can access
                    them to remember where you left off with a chat partner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chat moderators <strong>DO NOT</strong> get to see the contents of your Direct Message
                    conversations - that feature is not programmed in to this chat room. The server logs which
                    might capture your conversations are usually not actively monitored. Consider taking your especially
                    sensitive conversations to a different platform if you are very concerned about it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Webcam sharing is <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> so it is possible that your chat partner
                    could identify your IP address by checking their computer's open connections. But this is
                    true of basically all WebRTC webcam services and is part of how WebRTC works.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As with all video sharing services, it is always possible that your chat partner may screen
                    record their computer and thus record a copy of your video. This is a risk inherent with all
                    video sharing platforms - you can't control what software the other party may be running,
                    so choose your risk tolerance accordingly.
